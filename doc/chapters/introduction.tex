\section{Problem and Motivation}

Social Networks, such as Facebook\footnote{\url{http://www.facebook.com}},
MySpace\footnote{\url{http://www.myspace.com}} or
Twitter\footnote{\url{http://www.twitter.com}} gained millions of members on
their platforms in the last years. They are widely used in both private and
business networking. Also, they allow individuals to present their own user
profile and to share and maintain relationships with other members of those
networks. There is no doubt that social networks are a useful instrument and
pose a communication platform, which many people are using and even more will
be using in the near future~\cite{whitworth2009}.

The nature of social networks is about sharing data, but frequently users are
as well presenting their information to an unknown number of strangers. This
does not only raise the question of how useful a social network is for a single
user, but also if there are any drawbacks or risks in any form for the single
user or company. Users often put much and frequently sensitive data into their
profiles, as for example Brown et al. show~\cite{brown2008}. This data however
is stored centrally at the company which provides the network and so the user
looses the control over his data~\cite{fraunhofer2008}.

Of course there is a relation between the data, which the user entered, and the
user himself. Following that thought, another person is not only able to
extract the data but also to obtain new information or rather interpretations,
which were not entered by the user.

Many studies like~\cite{fraunhofer2008,gross2005} show that this can be a
massive intervention into one's privacy. This work however wants to examine
whether such information are a security risk and can be used for attacks
against a company or an individual. More precisely, it wants to determine how
social engineering attacks can be driven against users of social networks,
based on data, which is legally accessible on social networks.

Of course, a distinction between employees of a certain company and private
users has to be made, as certain information can be harmless to an
individual, but very well a danger to a company~\cite{mitnick2003}. For example
a phone number of a private person is probably harmless, while the phone number
of a certain office inside a company could be used for a social engineering
attack. In both cases, however, a social engineer saves additional time and
effort to get a specific information about his victim, if he can find the
information needed on a social network. Having to collect the
information by hand, does not only require extra work, but it also includes the
danger of being exposed. A social engineer has to remain undiscovered during
the attack, as he otherwise would not be able to carry out an attack
\cite{mitnick2003}.

Especially big corporations spend hundreds of thousands of dollars for the
security of their IT infrastructure. An attack on the IT layer would therefore
be often very laborious. Hence it is much simpler to bypass the security
mechanisms through social engineering, as it is very cheap and does not require
any superior technology~\cite{winkler1995}. Commonly, a skilled social
engineer does not require anything more than a telephone for such attacks
\cite{mitnick2003}.

Concretely, this study wants to answer the following research question:
How can data of individuals or companies automatically be extracted
from social networks and presented in a way that it can be used for a social
engineering attack. In addition, countermeasures against automatic extraction
and social engineering attacks are going to be developed.

\section{Methodology}

In this work, a five-step approach was used to characterize useful information,
extraction, attacks and countermeasures.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Data was obtained from the chosen social network from several users. The
data was taken from well known people on the network, as well as less famous.
Furthermore users who were very active such as less active users were
observed.

\item The data gathered in the first step was studied and it was determined
which attacks are possible. 

\item Three sample attacks were chosen, which took place in reality in the last
years. All of these attacks are described by Mitnick and Simon
\cite{mitnick2003}. The chosen attacks were then transfered to the prototype
and the chosen social network.

\item The attacks were tested on sample profiles for their feasibility and
efficiency.

\item Countermeasures were elaborated to mitigate the risk of such attacks.
