\chapter{Analysis of the social network \Twitter}
\label{chapter:analysis}

The work now wants to take a closer look at a concrete social network.
There are of course many social networks, which can be used for harvesting
data, however, as a case study, the work wants to concentrate on a big social
network, which is widely used by employees and individuals. Moreover,
an \textit{API} is needed to gather data automatically.

As a case study the choice was between \textit{Facebook} and
\Twitter. Both are widely used, however \Twitter{} was chosen due to many
already existing programs and platform bindings. Furthermore \Twitter{} is
somewhat more dynamic than \textit{Facebook}, as it offers the possibility to
parse \Twitter{} messages and not just handling static data.

\Twitter{} is a popular social networking and micro-blogging service, that
enables users to post messages and to let other users follow those messages.
The term \textit{micro-blogging} describes a form of communication, that
consists of brief messages in text form, which then can be send over a variety
of ways, like instant messages, mobile phones, e-mail or other \cite{java2007}.

\begin{figure}[hbt]

  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{twitter_screenshot}
  \caption{An example Twitter Homepage, featuring several \Twitter{}
  messages, account information and the users this account
  follows.}\label{fig:twitter_screenshot}
\end{figure}

Micro-blogging itself is relatively new, though already widely used and
provided by services like
\textit{Twitter}\footnote{http://www.twitter.com},
\textit{identi.ca}\footnote{http://identi.ca},
\textit{Jaiku}\footnote{http://www.jaiku.com} and others. \Twitter{} is one of
the most popular micro-blogging services \cite{java2007} and currently
exhibiting more than a million users. The accurate number unfortunately is not
available, however \cite{krishnamurthy2008} estimated about 1.4 million users
in 2008 and \cite{whitworth2009} calculated more than 1.78 million users in
2009.

\Twitter{} limits the length of the messages to 140 characters. The messages
are called \textit{updates} or \textit{tweets}.  The scopes of those messages
range from events, news, daily life and other interests \cite{java2007}. Of
course, other services like Instant Messaging also offers a way to communicate
the such informations, however micro-blogging allows to do this publicly.

As \cite{java2007} describes, micro-blogging is a faster way to communicate
compared to other means of communication, like blogging. It requires less time
to think and write a message, and this of course implements much quicker
\flqq{}write rate\frqq{}. This is of course one of the main differences
between blogging and micro-blogging, whereas an author spends several minutes
to hours to think up and write a blog post. As it now takes less time to think
and write a message, the frequency one can write such, increases and a
micro-blogger may posts several messages a day.

Users may choose to make their messages visible to all users (even those not
logged into \Twitter{}) or to just make them available to \textit{friends}. A
\textit{friend} is a relation inside the \Twitter{} platform, and allows a user
to \textit{follow} the messages from other members, who are added as a
\textit{friend}. Users, who are not a friend to another user can still follow
the user, who they are not friend with, but are then called \textit{follower}.
The friend relation is not forced to be mutual, but can be single-way too. In
addition, a user can choose to make his messages public or just available to
his friends. If the messages are marked as public, they will be displayed in
the public timeline, which can be accessed by the URL
\url{http://twitter.com/public_timeline}.

\cite{java2007} has found, that the types of user interactions are daily
chatter, conversations, sharing informations and reporting news. This of course
leads us to question, which information can be dangerous and which can be used
by a social engineer.

A sample \Twitter{} profile page is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:twitter_screenshot}. It features several elements, which we will
discuss in the next section. 

\Twitter{} messages can be sent and received by a variety of methods, all
listed in Figure \ref{fig:twitter_io}. Several of those are or were
discontinued for a certain amount of time, but either re-enabled or provided by
a third party company.

\section{\Twitter{} profile data}

As already mentioned, a \Twitter{} profile page consists of a series of
elements, which can be used for harvesting data. We now want to take a closer
look at those elements, the content and how a social engineer can extract data
out of those fields.

\begin{description}
\item[Name] This fields tells the real name of a user, it is limited to 20
            characters. It is required to enter a name, albeit a bogus name is
            also accepted. The field is required.\\
            \textit{Example: Peter Sample}
\item[Username] The username is presented with this field. A username is needed
                to create an URL, which is of the form \url{http://www.twitter.com/[username]}.
                Therefore only letters, numbers and underscore are allowed. The maximum length
                is set to 15 characters. The field is required.\\
                \textit{Example: petersample}
\item[E-mail] Though not visible publicly, a \Twitter{} user has to provide an
              e-mail address. As described by \cite{brown2008}, though not provided an e-mail
              address can be build out of a naming scheme and the already
              given data, like the username and the real name. If the user
              is an employee of a certain company, this might be even easier,
              as companies often have certain naming schemes. The field is required.\\
              \textit{Example: petersample@example.com}
\item[More Info URL] The URL is used to link a visitor of a profile to further
                     websites, like the blog of the owner. It can link to
                     any site on the internet. The shown component of the
                     URL is 17 characters. Except XSS prevention,
                     \Twitter{} does not rewrite of the URL, and port numbers
                     after the TLD, spaces, German umlauts and UTF-8 characters were
                     accepted.\\
                     \textit{Example:} \url{http://www.petersample.com/},\\
                     \texttt{http://www.peter sample.com:8080/äöü$\Gamma\Lambda\Sigma\Psi$.htm}
\item[One Line Bio] A short sentence can be shown on the profile page, where a
                    user can describe himself. It it limited to 160
                    characters.\\
                    \textit{Example: I am a computer science expert and work
                    for example.com}
\item[Location] The location will also be shown on the profile page and is
                limited to 30 characters.\\
                \textit{Example: Munich}
\item[Picture] A user can insert a picture of himself, although it is not
               required to do so. Moreover, if a user publishes an image, it does not have to
               show himself, but can also be anything else.
\item[Following] Describes a list of users, the profile owner is \textit{following}.
                 To see the list, one has to be logged in.
\item[Followers] This gives us a list of users on the \Twitter{} network, who
                 are \textit{following} the profile owner. To see the list, one has to be logged in.
\item[Favorites] A user can mark his messages or the messages from other users as
                 a favorite, which displays a
                 yellow star beneath them. A users favorite messages can be viewed
                 by visiting \url{http://twitter.com/favorites?user=[username]}.
\item[Messages] Finally the messages, which are composed by the actual message,
                which is limited to 140 characters, the time, when the message
                was written and by which mean. A message is identified by a unique
                id, e.g. 1767572233 and can be accessed by
                \url{http://twitter.com/[username]/status/[message id]}.

                \Twitter{} also offers special commands, which can enhance a
                message or turn a \Twitter{} into a query tool.
  \begin{description}
    \item[@username + message]
      A message can be sent directly to another person, though still visible
      publicly.\\
      \textit{Example: @petersample yes, you are totally right!}

    \item[D username + message]
      In contrast to the command above, this message is entirely private and
      not visible by other users.\\
      \textit{Example: D petersample this is a private message for peter!}

    \item[WHOIS username]
      retrieves information of any public user on the \Twitter{} platform.
      Currently, this command returns the real name, the date since the user
      has an account on \Twitter{}, the one line bio, the website and the
      location.\\
      \textit{Example: WHOIS petersample}\\
      \textit{Answer: Peter Sample, since May 2009. bio: I am a computer
              science expert and work for example.com. location: Munich web:
              \url{http://www.petersample.com/}}

    \item[GET username]
      gets the last message this user posted.\\
      \textit{Example: GET petersample}\\
      \textit{Answer: petersample: This is my latest message (1 day ago)}

    \item[NUDGE username]
      sends a note to the user, reminding him to post a message.\\
      \textit{Example: NUDGE petersample}\\
      \textit{Answer (sent to petersample): You've been nudged! [my-username] wants to know what you're doing. Reply to this
      message to update your Twitter friends.}

    \item[FAV username]
      marks the last message of username as a favorite\\
      \textit{Example: FAV petersample}

    \item[STATS]
      returns the number of followers and how many users the account itself is
      following.\\
      \textit{Example: STATS}\\
      \textit{Answer: followers: 135 following: 47}

    \item[INVITE phone number]
      sends an invite SMS to the phone number\\
      \textit{Example: INVITE 123 456 7890}

\section{Message classification}

\cite{java2007} described a classification of the messages on the \Twitter{}
platform. After they gained a dataset, the author and his team tried to
categorize each message. The results were the following:

\begin{description}

\item[Daily Chatter]
Most users on \Twitter{} post about what they are currently doing or similar
things. Of course, they are answering the question \flqq{}What are you
doing?\frqq{}, which can be found over the input field of a message. This is
the most common use of the \Twitter{} platform.

\item[Conversations]
There are two ways to communicate with another user, one is by public
messaging, which features the @ symbol like stated above, the other one is
private messaging, which uses the D character. \cite{java2007} discovered, that
about one eighth of all posts in their dataset contained a public conversation
and about 21\% of the users in their dataset used this type of messaging. Of
course, there is no data available about private messages.

\item[Reporting news]
Another big piece of the cake is done by users, who report or comment news and
events. Some of them are automated and post weather reports, other are
eyewitnesses and report and event in their location.

\item[Sharing information/URLs]
Many users also share information and websites, and therefore uses services,
like \textit{TinyURL}\footnote{\url{http://tinyurl.com/}} or
\textit{tr.im}\footnote{\url{http://tr.im/}}. According to \cite{java2007},
about 13\% of all posts in the dataset contain at least one URL.
