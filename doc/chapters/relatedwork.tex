\section{Social Engineering}

In most companies and private networks, the main focus on security aims towards
secure technology, like firewalls or anti-virus programs and other defense
strategies. However, most companies and private persons are unaware of social
engineering, which sometimes is a lot more dangerous than the IT-security
suggests. Kevin Mitnick, a famous Hacker and one of the most famous social
engineers, states that it is often easier to use social engineering to get
access to a system than searching for security holes \cite{mitnick2003}.

\comment{correct citation and full cite}
The Jargon Dictionary \cite{jargon} defines the term social engineering as
following: \glqq{}A Term for cracking techniques that rely on weaknesses in
wetware rather than software; the aim is to trick people into revealing
passwords or other information that compromises a target system's security.\grqq{}

Beside the definition it is also important, to understand, how a social
engineer relates to a hacker in general. \cite{thornburgh2004} proposes, that
social engineers are not hackers themselves, but are \textit{hacker-enablers}.
The goal of the social engineer is to gain direct either physical or
digital access to an information of the target or an information system.
Afterwards the social engineer can enable a hacker to access and penetrate the
system, delete, alter and steal information and to disrupt services, as
\cite{thornburgh2004} shows. The social engineer can of course be also the
hacker. \cite{jones2003} states, that unlike hacking, social engineering
uses psychology and the human mindset, like what people expect from each other
and their natural tendency to be helpful.

\subsection{The cycle of an social engineering attack}

Defining the profile of an social engineering attack is quite difficult, as
every attack includes people, who are not discrete like a computer, but their
behaviour changes from time to time, their mood and other things. However,
\cite{mitnick2003} identified four stages of a social engineering attack:
research, developing rapport and trust, exploiting trust and utilizing
information. A single cycle does not have to be limited to a single cycle, but
can contain several other cycles until the objective is reached, as
\cite{thornburgh2004} states. The process itself can be therefore recursive and
iterative, depending on the attack and used methods.

\subsubsection{Research}

This phase consists of several methodologies to gain as much information about
the target as possible. Depending however if the target is a company or a
private person, different methods might be used. The ultimate goal of this
phase is to gain as much information as possible to develop a relationship,
rapport and trust in the next phase. Of course, there are enormous
possibilities to get information about companies and individuals, the most
known are described by \cite{jones2003,mitnick2003,thornburgh2004}, but of
course are not limited to those.

\begin{description}[\setlabelphantom{Personal Homepage}]

\item[Corporate Website] The Website of a company might be the first place to
  start looking out for information. Lists of employees,
  company directors, or company brochures are often viewable on such websites. 
\item[Personal Homepage] If the target is an individual, the personal homepage
  of the target might offer more information, than the company website. If the
  target is running a blog, information about the workplace can be accessed
  also quite often. This information however can be used to attack the
  employer.
\item[Dumpster Diving] This is a technique was and is also used by certain
  information intelligence agencies [CITATION NEEDED]. It included the search
  for useful information in the dumpster of companies and individuals. While
  this seems a strange technique, a social engineer still can gain much
  information out of this.
\item[Phishing] Fake e-mails or websites are set up and send or accessed by
  individuals. They both have the goal to make the target believe, that they are
  watching a regular e-mail or website and entering sensitive information.
  Phishing can also be described as a whole social engineering attack, however
  it can also be used to just get special information.
\item[Trojan Horses and other Malware] This tools have the same goal like
  phishing, however they are acting by themselves and often do not require any
  user interaction, except might for installing the software. Again, they can
  be used for other things as well, but for example a keylogger or a tool,
  which logs the website the target is accessing or the e-mails can be
  important information too.
\item[Newsgroups and mailing lists] Several employees or individuals are
  subscribed to public accessible newsgroups and mailing lists. Often these are
  technical groups and lists and therefore expose information, like what system
  is getting used and how it is configured.
\item[Job Sites] Companies are often looking for new people to hire and many
  times, they have to include sensitive information, if they are looking for
  people with experience in that field. Like above, information about the
  computer systems can also be obtained here.
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Rapport and trust}

In this phase, the social engineer will make contact via several ways of
communication. The attacker uses techniques like name-dropping, where he will
tell several names of verifiable employees or persons to make the target
believe, the attacker is who he pretends. Once the attacker has established
himself as authentic, he will go on with the next phase. \cite{jones2003} shows
the following physical settings, an attack can happen:

\begin{description}[\setlabelphantom{Workplace}]
\item[Telephone] The most common type of social engineering attacks are those
  made by using the telephone. Quite every person is vulnerable to this type,
  especially call desks, but also individuals and employees.
\item[Workplace] This is a quite dangerous type, as an attacker has to gain
  physical access to the targets workplace. However, there are many
  possibilities, a talented attacker can gain legitimate access to a building.
  Once inside, the attacker can look out for passwords, sensitive documents,
  do shoulder-surfing or access computers and network, which are left
  accessible unguarded.
\item[E-Mail] The social engineer can compose an original looking document,
  either from the company, the target works for, another company or a service,
  the target uses, like a social network.
\item[Chat] Like the above, the attacker connects to the victim directly,
  forcing the target to install malicious software or exposing sensitive
  information.
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Exploiting trust}

Once the connection has been established, the attacker can exploit the trust by
\glqq{}weaving a story that plays upon the emotions of the
victim\grqq{} \cite{thornburgh2004}. Social engineers heavily rely on
psychology to exploit their trust. \cite{jones2003} lists the following:

\begin{description}[\setlabelphantom{Workplace}]
\item[Authority] This is can be a highly effective psychological weapon, for
  example when impersonating the boss of the company. \cite{orgill2004} has
  showed in a real case study, that social engineering attacks are even more
  effective, when the supervisor of an employees supports the attack or and
  attacker impersonates a supervisor.
\item[Natural tendency to be helpful] Psychology shows, that it is a natural
  tendency, to be helpful. A social engineer can use this to his advantage.
  Several examples are showed by \cite{mitnick2003}, like desperate calls in
  the night to the help desk, or a person with many boxes in his hand, trying
  to get access to the building.
\item[Liking and similarity] A personal connection might be helpful for the
  attacker. Psychology shows, that it is natural to like people who are like
  themselves. If information about hobbies or interests are available, a social
  engineer might use that information to establish a relationship based on that
  information. Once this connections has been made, the victim may feel more
  responsive to the attacker and therefore might be offer more sensitive
  information.
\item[Reciprocation] Social interaction is often based on the fact, that if
  someone gives something, one might give him something back. In social
  engineering, this is called \textit{reverse social engineering}. Here, a
  social engineer tries to help the victim and in return requests a favour of
  the victim.
\item[Low involvement] If a person has low to no involvement in the company or
  to a victim, it might have little interest in what the social engineer is
  asking. Often, receptionists, the cleaning crew and similar people are the
  favourite victims.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Utilizing Information}

This phase finally utilizes the gained information to either implement a
technical attack or to use the gained information for a new social engineering
attack \cite{thornburgh2004}. The actual attack and the threat it exposes is
created in this phase. It is interesting, that the attack created here, does
not limit itself to technical attacks, but can also be used to publish
sensitive information or other.
